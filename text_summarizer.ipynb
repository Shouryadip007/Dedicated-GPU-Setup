These growths are graded from 1 to 4 based on their aggressiveness and can cause a variety of neurological symptoms—such as seizures, severe headaches, and cognitive shifts—by increasing intracranial pressure or damaging vital tissues. Diagnosis typically relies on advanced MRI imaging and biopsies, while modern treatment strategies in 2026 have evolved beyond traditional surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy to include highly targeted immunotherapies and AI-assisted surgical mapping.\n"
